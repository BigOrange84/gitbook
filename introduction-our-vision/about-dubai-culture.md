The official language of the country is Arabic, however most people in and out of the workplace communicate in English. There are so many different nationalities in Dubai, English finds common ground with most people. The majority of road and shop signs, restaurant menus etc. are in both English and Arabic. Dubai is a cosmopolitan city and visitors can dress however they like. Still, a good amount of respect for local customs is appreciated
